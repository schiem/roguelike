/**
 * The primary data model and memory-loading bottleneck.
 *
 * The Chunk Matrix is a square matrix with a diameter that is given at
 * construction. The matrix is initialized using populate_initial, given central
 * chunk coordinates on the world map and a reference to the world map.
 *
 * For each of those chunks, that function calls the init() method, which will
 * by default construct the chunks if they haven't already been saved to the
 * filesystem or load them from the filesystem if they have.
 *
 * Every time the main character crosses a chunk boundary, shift_matrix will be
 * called. The chunk matrix will load in the proper chunks, creating or
 * deserializing chunks as needed.
